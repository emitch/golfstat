Score Sunday was the best final round among the field and equaled the lowest final round in tournament annals (Tom Kite\/2003). It was also his best score since he posted a final-round 63 at the 2009 ACE Group Classic. Performance at Fox Chapel GC came in his record 66th consecutive start in a senior major championship...Added two more starts in majors and began the 2015 season with a streak of 68 consecutive major championship appearances on Tour...Will also begin the 2015 season with a streak of 84 consecutive starts in events for which he was eligible. \n\n2013: Reached a career milestone in October when he played in his 1,000th event (PGA TOUR and Champions Tour) at the Greater Hickory Kia Classic at Rock Barn, becoming just the 19th player in history with as many combined starts on both circuits in his career...Best finish during the year came in his final start when he was T22 at the AT&T Championship in San Antonio. \n\n2012: Once again played a busy schedule, with 20-plus starts on his calender for the 12th consecutive year...Best finishes were a pair of T14s at The Principal Charity Classic (in defense of his 2011 title) and at the Dick's Sportings Goods Open. \n\n2011: Nearly earned a place among the top-30 money-winners for the first time in three years but fell one spot shy, finishing 31st on the final money listâseven spots better than his finish the previous year...Won his 10th career Champions Tour title and second victory in West Des Moines, Iowa, when he birdied three of the last four holes to overtake Mark Brooks at The Principal Charity Classic. Trailed Brooks by four strokes heading to the 15th tee Sunday, but after birdies at Nos. 15 and 16, holed a dramatic 30-foot birdie putt on the final hole and then watched a faltering Brooks miss a 5-foot par putt that would have sent the event to a playoff. Win in Iowa ended a victory drought of 4 years, 8 months 13 days, and he joined Jay Haas as a multiple winner of the Principal event. Victory at 60 years, 6 months, 5 days, made him the oldest winner of the Iowa event and, coupled with 61-year-old Tom Watson's win the week prior at the Senior PGA Championship, gave the Champions Tour its first back-to-back winners over age 60 in the history of the circuit. Best finish in a stroke-play event prior to coming to Iowa was a T56 twice, but made 15 birdies and just one bogey at Glen Oaks for the victory. Iowa appearance was his 178th consecutive for which he was eligible, passing Mike McCullough for second on the all-time list behind Dana Quigley (278 straight).

His 9-under-par score moved him into a T29 at The ACE Group Classic. Record round in Naples came one day after he shot 83. The 20-stroke differential matched the second-biggest swing from one round to the next in Champions Tour history. \n\n2008: Made his eighth consecutive appearance in the Charles Schwab Cup Championship for the Tour's top-30 money winners. His T30 finish at the AT&T Championship allowed him to jump Joe Ozaki and claim the coveted 30th and final spot. \n\n2007: Only player to compete in all 29 events during the season...Final-round 65 at The Raven jumped him up into a T3 at The Boeing Championship at Sandestin.

Needed just 78 putts and credited a switch to the \"claw\" putter grip three months earlier for his success near Baltimore...First experimented with the \"claw\" after first round of the Allianz Championship and was among the leaders of that event after 36 holes.
