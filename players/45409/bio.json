Had an up-and-down front nine on the final day at Lushan International GC. Opened birdie-birdie then made two consecutive bogeys before going birdie-bogey over his next two holes. Finished his nine with two more birdies to make the turn in 2-under. Was 2-over on the back nine for an even-par 70 and a T9 with Zheng Ouyang and Byungmin Cho...His solid season got considerably better in late-November at the Hainan Open in Sanya. At Dragon Valley GC, had a disappointing 75-73 start in windy conditions then picked up his pace in the third round. Fired a 1-under 71 to move into a 12th-place tie with 18 holes to go. Trailed 54-hole leaders Mu Hu and Zecheng Dou by four strokes entering the final round. Shot the round of the day Sunday, a 5-under 67. Had four front-nine birdies then added two more by the time he had finished the 13th hole. Still trailed by two shots, but when Dou ran into trouble, making triple bogey at the par-4 15th, he was in position to win. Made an 18th-hole birdie and then watched as nobody could match his 2-under posted score. The victory was his first of any kind since he turned professional in 2012, and his ￥216,000 payday was the largest of his career. Moved to No. 7 on the Order of Merit, also a career-high position.","carHigh" : "2014: Made his first PGA TOUR China cut when he T37 at the United Investment Real Estate Wuhan Open.
