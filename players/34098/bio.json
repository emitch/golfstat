His two-putt birdie after the quartet returned to No. 18 for sudden death was good for the win. The triumph made him just the third American winner of the event in the last 10 years, joining Mark Wilson (2007) and Michael Thompson (2013).

Closing the event with five consecutive birdies helped him become the first rookie to win in his first start as an official member of the PGA TOUR since Garrett Willis at the 2001 Touchstone Energy Tucson Open. In addition to becoming the ninth player to make the Sony Open in Hawaii his first PGA TOUR win (and first since Jerry Kelly in 2002), his 72-hole numerical total of 256 broke the tournament-scoring mark of 260 set by John Huston in 1998 and matched by Brad Faxon in 2001. His 256 was also the third-lowest 72-hole total (tie with Mark Calcavecchia at the 2001 Phoenix Open) in PGA TOUR history.

Won the extra session on the first hole with a par, two-putting from 20 feet. Hoffmann had hit his second shot in the water moments before Henley's approach shot and made bogey. Cantlay hit his drive in a fairway bunker, was short of the green in two, hit a poor pitch and then missed the 15-foot par effort.
