Carded nine birdies and an eagle on the last day, finishing more than three hours in front of the final groups. Wound up at 10-under 274. Finish was his best on Tour since a T3 at the 2009 Utah Championship. His round of 61 was the best final-round score in the 20-year history of the tournament. His score also bettered his previous career low of 64, which he had shot six different times. His 61 was one off the course record of 60 by Brenden Pappas in 2007...Did not record another top 10 until he posted a very timely T7 at the Winn-Dixie Jacksonville Open, which moved him from 67th to 57th on the money list and into the following week's Web.com Tour Championship.\n\n2010: Played 24 Web.com Tour events and made nine cuts. Ended the year No. 90 on the money list. Posted his lone top-10 of the season in his 23rd start of the year, at the Miccosukee Championship. Back-to-back 67s on the weekend led to a T4 finish. \n\n2009: Ended the Web.com Tour season No. 49 on the money list after making 13 of 27 cuts and posting three top-10 finishes. Finished T2 at the Stonebrae Classic, his best performance on Tour since his victory at the 2007 South Georgia Classic. Earned his second top-10 with a T3 at the Utah Championship, where he was in contention for much of the week. Was one stroke out of the lead after 36 and 54 holes. Posted only one bogey in the first three days but had three during the final round when he carded a 1-over 72. Birdied eight holes in a nine-hole stretch during the final round of the WNB Golf Classic and posted an 8-under 64 at Midland CC to move into a T7. Birdie streak included six in a row, starting at No. 4. Ended the year No. 5 in Total Driving. \n\n2008: Made the cut in 12 of 25 starts, with three top-25 finishes. Best showings were in back-to-back weeks, a T18 at the Melwood Prince George's County Open and a T22 at the Bank of America Open. \n\n2007: Made the cut in nine of 29 starts during his rookie season on the Web.com Tour, including five top-25 finishes. Ended the year No. 37 on the money list, with $160,444. Opened the year with three top-20 finishes in his first six starts, culminating with his first career victoryâat the South Georgia Classic. A 3-under 69 made him the only player in the field to record a sub-70 round Sunday. It was enough to give him a one-stroke win over Matthew Jones and a first-place paycheck of $108,000. The win came just seven months after he claimed his third NGA Hooters Tour title on the same golf course. Struggled the rest of the season, making just five cuts in 22 starts. Only other top-10 came at the final full-field event of the year when he finished T10 at the Miccosukee Championship.
