Nearly withdrew Thursday morning because he felt ill due to medication for a lingering sinus infection but finished with a final-round 72 to win at age 22. Held a two-stroke lead over Blake Adams entering the final round. But thought he might have blown it when, holding a one-stroke lead, his approach to the final hole went into the water (for the third time on the week on that hole). But he got a reprieve when playing partner Adamsâ€”who said he didn't see where Day's ball wentâ€”knocked his ball into the water, too.

The win began a five-tournament stretch where he posted four top-five finishes, including a T5 at the Nationwide Children's Hospital Invitational, a runner-up effort at the Cox Classic and a third-place finish at the Xerox Classic.
