At the event at Finca Cortesin in Spain, his clubs didn't arrive on his flight, so he put together a set that included John Senden's backup driver and a putter from the clubhouse for his first match.

Eventually T5, with his own clubs, losing to eventual champion Nicolas Colsaerts in the quarterfinals, 4 and 3...Finished T3 in his fourth Open Championship, having missed the cut in his first three (2008-09 and 2011).

Held a one-stroke lead over Adam Scott heading into the weekend, but rounds of 73-74 led to a T3 finish.

Added his name to the list of previous winners, Tiger Woods, Vijay Singh, Jim Furyk and Bill Haas. Final round was close for most of the way, but birdies on three of his last six holes (including a chip-in for birdie from the front of the 17th green) helped him hold off final-round charges for a three-stroke win over Justin Rose and four-shot margin over Donald and Ryan Moore. For his efforts, earned $1,440,000 for winning the tournament and $10 million for the FedExCup title...Went 1-2 for the U.S. team in his first career appearance in the Ryder Cup.
