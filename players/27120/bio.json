Final-round, 7-under 64 included a streak of seven consecutive birdies on Nos. 9-15 (had only three birdies on those holes during the first three rounds), just one shy of the tournament record. The streak could have been eight had his approach shot not hit the flagstick and bounded 24 feet, 3 inches from the pin.

On the first playoff hole (par-4 18th), both hit their approach shots into the water hazard and made double bogey. Back at 18 for the third time of the day, he couldn't match Johnson's birdie and finished second.

Had a chance to win the tournament in regulation but bogeyed the 17th and 18th holes.
