A new forward tee has been built on the left so that this former par-5 hole will play as a par 4-and-a-half. Depending on the wind the second shot to a very shallow green that is guarded in front by a huge, deep bunker can be played with anything from a 3-wood to a 9-iron. Welcome to Waialae.","image":""},{"number":"2","parValue":"4","yards":"426","body":"A tee moved 60 yards back and across the stream has really added teeth to this hole. It brings the lake, which runs down the left side back into play for the longer hitters. A very demanding tee shot must be placed between the lake and two fairway bunkers guarding the right side. A good drive will leave a middle iron to a fairly generous green.","image":""},{"number":"3","parValue":"4","yards":"423","body":"Named after Mr. Golf in Hawaii, Waialae founding member, Francis 'I'l Brown, who once drove this green. The tee box moved forward and to the left in 1999 bringing the lake more into play on the drives. A long accurate drive off the tee is rewarded with a short iron shot on this dangerous second shot to the green.","image":""},{"number":"4","parValue":"3","yards":"203","body":"A very difficult par 3 played into the wind. The elongated 55-yard green has a deep swale running across the middle. Par is welcome here.","image":""},{"number":"5","parValue":"4","yards":"466","body":"Blast from the past. The championship tee has been rebuilt 30 yards back to the design played before the late 1970s. The tee shot calls for a 226-yard carry over the first ditch which is generally not a problem with the prevailing winds coming from the back. If the wind switches, however, watch out. A drive that makes it over the ditch leaves a short iron shot. Putting is very tricky on the heavily contoured green. Birdies are rare on this hole.","image":""},{"number":"6","parValue":"4","yards":"459","body":"A prevailing left-to-right wind blows straight towards O.B. on the right. Drives have been known to go astray here. Trees protect the right corner of the dogleg so a well-placed drive bust be kept left of the tee box avoiding the new faiway bunker. The green is bunkered on both sides so a very accurate short iron is needed for the second shot.","image":""},{"number":"7","parValue":"3","yards":"167","body":"The second of the par 3s on the front. This green is as wide as the par-3 fourth green was long. Originally this green was completely surrounded by sand giving the hole its name. Bunkers still wrap around the entire front side of this green. A deep ridge on the front green runs laterally front to back.","image":""},{"number":"8","parValue":"4","yards":"459","body":"With a new tee moved 20 yards back in 1999, the tee shot is the hairy shot on this hole. Played through a chute of trees, the drive must carry a stream that is 230 yards out, avoiding two fairway bunkers on the right. Once that is accomplished, a short iron is left to the hole. A definite birdie opportunity.","image":""},{"number":"9","parValue":"5","yards":"510","body":"Normally played as No. 18 by Waialae members, this par 5 requires accuracy on both the drive and the second shot. O.B. runs down the entire hole on both sides. A strong left-to-right wind makes things even tougher. It is reachable in two strokes, however, and has given up its share of birdies.","image":""},{"number":"10","parValue":"4","yards":"353","body":"This is the shortest par 4 on the couse. The best place for the drive is on the right side of the fairway. Several deep bunkers and three towering palm trees standing sentry on the left protect the green. This is a good birdie hole.","image":""},{"number":"11","parValue":"3","yards":"196","body":"The real challenge on the tee shot is to avoid the potential scenic distraction of the vast sweeping view of the Pacific Ocean behind the green. The prevailing wind blows left to right so the large bunker on the right gets lots of action. This is an excellenct one-shot hole.","image":""},{"number":"12","parValue":"4","yards":"446","body":"A long hole requiring both length and accuracy off the tee, the drive must be placed between the fairway bunker on the left and the series of mounds and trees on the right. A middle to short iron sets up an easy birdie putt on a relatively flat putting surface.","image":""},{"number":"13","parValue":"4","yards":"478","body":"Formerly played as a par-5 at the Hawaiian Open, the redesigned forward tee allows playing this hole as a 475-yard par 4. The fairway bunker on the right has been reshaped to allow more room in the landing area for the drive. Par is now a very good score on this hole.","image":""},{"number":"14","parValue":"4","yards":"433","body":"A dogleg left par 4, this hole plays back towards the mountains. A well-placed drive to the right side of the fairway leaves a short iron shot to the green that is sloped steeply form back to front. Best to stay below the pin for the ideal birdie putt.","image":""},{"number":"15","parValue":"4","yards":"396","body":"The hole can certainly be troublesome. O.B. runs up the entire left side, and both the drive and second shots are played into the wind. Tee shots out to the right are blocked on the second shot by a huge, old kiawe tree which dominates the right side of the fairway about 100 yards from the hole.","image":""},{"number":"16","parValue":"4","yards":"417","body":"Teed high it flies. A finish with the wind at your back. The best place for the drive is on the right side of the fariway just inside the fairway bunker. The second shot is a short iron played to a green framed by the Pacific Ocean and several large palm trees. This hole is considered the most scenic at Waialae.","image":""},{"number":"17","parValue":"3","yards":"189","body":"The signature hole at Waialae bears the name of the Sony Open fire-bird of Hawaiian lore. No. 17 is a very difficult par 3 requiring a long or middle iron. Recently, the green was restored to the original Seth Raynor design, a clasic Redan-style green with a large bunker on the left and a series of four deep, hidden bunkers guarding the right. Par 3 is a good score here, especially in the final round.","image":""},{"number":"18","parValue":"5","yards":"551","body":"A great finishing hole. Isao Aoki proved this in 1983 with a spectacular eagle for his victory. Aoki knocked it in from 128 yards out, but this hole is reachable in two strokes. A bunker set in the dogleg makes the traditional drive off the tee a \"thinking shot.\" A second shot can be played straight downwind to the green.","image":""}]}]}
