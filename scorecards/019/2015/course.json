There is a fairway bunker, guarding the left and right side of the green.","image":""},{"number":"2","parValue":"3","yards":"221","body":"The 2nd tee has been moved back about 30 yards which has created a great viewing area as well as a challenging tee shot.

Two more bunkers guard the front right approach to the green.","image":""},{"number":"5","parValue":"3","yards":"174","body":"The shared green of holes 5 and 9 has been separated, giving each hole its own identity.
