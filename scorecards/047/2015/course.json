The community is currently home to more than 100,000 residents.<\/P>\n<P>As a stadium course, the TPC Summerlin was built to accommodate golfing fans with unrestricted views of tee shots, fairway approaches and putting through strategically placed spectator mounds and natural amphitheaters. Still, the integrity of the course remains.<\/P>\n<P>The TPC Summerlin is one of two TPC Network members in Nevada. The TPC network currently encompasses 25 courses in 10 states and, with the addition of non-domestic TPCs, three foreign countries. The TPC network is designed and managed by subsidiaries of the PGA TOUR.

The tee shot angle must be figured in relation to the diagonal wash carry, with bunkers guarding the left side. The green is large with a bunker bordering the right side. <\/P>\n<P><STRONG>How to watch:<\/STRONG> The second tee stands very close to the eighth green and ninth tee, allowing fans a chance to see plenty of action from here. <\/P>\n<P><STRONG>Hole history:<\/STRONG> Jonathan Kaye birdied this, as well as the first and third holes, en route to closing to within two of 1999 winner Jim Furyk. In 1996, Tiger Woods played this hole in 2 under for the tournament to help propel him to his first PGA TOUR victory.

Your best bet is to sit above the green and watch as the players attempt to reach the green in two. <\/P>\n<P><STRONG>Hole history:<\/STRONG> Harrison Frazar made a 10-foot eagle putt to help put him in a three-way tie for the lead on Friday in 1999's tournament.

A deep bunker front and right of the green makes a right pin position most difficult. <\/P>\n<P><STRONG>How to watch:<\/STRONG> The fourth hole, a long, tough par-4, begins a circle of five holes. If you follow the players on this hole, plan on watching the fifth through ninth holes as well. <\/P>\n<P><STRONG>Hole history:<\/STRONG> 1997 Champion Bill Glasson bogeyed this hole to fall temporarily into a tie with Billy Mayfair. This hole ranks in the middle range each year in terms of difficulty.

No green access is available to spectators. <\/P>\n<P><STRONG>Hole history:<\/STRONG> Although the&nbsp;Frys.com Open&nbsp;is a tournament known for low scores, no winner has played this hole under par. During 1999's final round, the hole yielded six bogeys and four double-bogeys, more doubles than any other hole.

Glasson played it at 1-over par.<\/P>","image":""},{"number":"6","parValue":"4","yards":"430","body":"<P>This hole played slightly uphill and has a narrow fairway. The green is elevated and set in left to right with no bunkers. Most players hit an extra club to the green after hitting shorter tee shots to ensure fairway placement. <\/P>\n<P><STRONG>How to watch:<\/STRONG> This is one of the toughest holes to watch on the golf course. Fans are diverted away from the tee box, and tight fairways add to viewing difficulty. <\/P>\n<P><STRONG>Hole history:<\/STRONG> In the past, Las Vegas professional Bob May played the hole in 1-under par. Jim Furyk played this hole in 1-over par in 1999, with a bogey in Saturday's round.

Fans also can stand close to the green. <\/P>\n<P><STRONG>Hole history:<\/STRONG> It's one of seven holes in which scoring has averaged under par each year. In three rounds, 1999 champion Jim Furyk played the hole in 2-under par.

A large green with bail-out left awaits tee shots that, if they are hit short and right, will invariably wind up in one of four front bunkers. <\/P>\n<P><STRONG>How to watch:<\/STRONG> A berm surrounding the green offers a great place to sit, relax and watch as players hit to this par-3. This is the longest par-3 on the course, so many players face a tricky chip into the putting surface. <\/P>\n<P><STRONG>Hole history:<\/STRONG> Fred Couples, who tied for 10th in 1999, played the hole without a par during the weekend. He double-bogeyed Saturday, then birdied it Sunday. In 1999's final round, there were only five birdies on the day, compared with 57 pars and nine bogeys.

It plays downhill, giving spectators good vantage points. <\/P>\n<P><STRONG>Hole history:<\/STRONG> During 1999's final round, this hole gave up fewer birdies (four) than any other hole.

The approach is to a green with a false tongue and deep bunker protecting the left side pin placement. <\/P>\n<P><STRONG>How to watch:<\/STRONG> For fans following a particular player, the 11th can be interesting scorewise, but it doesn't provide the best vantage point for watching. <\/P>\n<P><STRONG>Hole history: In<\/STRONG> 1999's final round, this hole tied with the second hole for most bogeys (14). Kevin Sutherland and Jonathan Kaye were the only players in the top 10 to birdie this hole Sunday.
