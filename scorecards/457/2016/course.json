The course bends through three distinct landscapes - tropical jungle, dense mangroves, and oceanfront stretches of sand with holes bisected by massive limestone canals. Norman even incorporated a cenote, a massive, ancient cavern common to the area, into the heart of the opening fairway. And as in all Norman projects, he has balanced the course to make it enjoyable for golfers of all abilities. From the tips, El Camaleon is a major league test; however, each hole is sprinkled with a minimum of five tee blocks, so there is a distance for every player.<\/P>\n<P>While the course is a standout, the surrounding golf amenities are equally as stunning. The handsome, Mayan influenced clubhouse rises above the 18th green and the adjoining practice facility and driving range are five star. Even more amazingly, with the resort's unique canal system, golfers will be able to step out of their rooms and into a boat, which will ferry them to the first tee.<\/P>\n<P>In 2007, El Camaleon made history by becoming the first golf course to host an official PGA TOUR event in Mexico. <\/P>","image":"\/tournaments\/r457\/images\/201304251856486925592SVRN974UWH.jpg","holes": [{"number":"1","parValue":"5","yards":"554","body":"<P>The first hole is a 554-yard par 5 that plays left to right. The wide fairway is split by a unique cenote (cave) that provides a great target for your drive. The green sits left to right and is guarded by bunkers left and right.

The tees are separated from the approach and green by a large waste area, and the long narrow green sits slightly right to left.

The hole plays left to right while the green sits right to left and is guarded on the left by a large bunker.

From the back tees, the hole plays straight away at 451 yards. The fairway is very wide and cut into the existing terrain to help feed balls back to the middle. The green is raised and is small considering the heavy slopes that surround it, so approach shots are best played high and soft.<\/P>","image":"\/tournaments\/r457\/images\/200801101737526099716SVRN7AQUJP.jpg"},{"number":"13","parValue":"5","yards":"532","body":"<P>The only hole at El Camaleon to begin in the forest and end in the mangroves, this medium length par 5 measures&nbsp;532 yards.
