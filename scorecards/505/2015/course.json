Long hitters will be tempted here to drive the green but beware of the substantial bunker with island features that guards the left front.

Players will have to consider 3-wood off the tee as some chocolate mounds now line the left rough in the drive zone. A new green is now smaller, more undulated and positioned closer to the water in the front and right. Those trying to reach in two will now face two gnarly bunkers positioned in the 'old' catch basin to the left of the green along with a strategic mound protecting the front left.
