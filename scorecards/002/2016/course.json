At 7,300 yards, the TPC Stadium Course has the highest stroke (76.1) and slope (150) ratings of all the courses at PGA WEST&#174;.<\/P>\n<P>A Pete Dye golf course, TPC Stadium delivers multiple adrenaline rushes throughout the round. Host to PGA TOUR \"Q-School\" Finals every other year, PGA TOUR hopefuls must navigate the island green of hole #17, known as Alcatraz, as well as the menacing water-lined 18th. Imagine needing to make par-par on two of the toughest finishing holes in golf to earn the coveted PGA TOUR card!<\/P>\n<P>Named \"Stadium\" thanks to Dye's ingenious plan to sculpt spectator seating into the natural terrain, many historic moments in golf have occurred here, including Lee Trevino's unforgettable hole-in-one on Alcatraz. This won him a carry-over Skin worth $175,000 in the 1987 made-for-TV \"Skins Game,\" hosted at PGA WEST from 1986-1991.

Its best not to cheat the corner due to the large eucalyptus and mesquite trees on the left.

There are two fairway bunkers on this hole: one is short, left and the other is long, right. The stretch of fairway, near the bunker on the right, is sloped to the left. which will add distance to the shot. The approach shot must be accurate. This green is guarded by a bunker short of the green, on the left side, as well as bunkers around the green.","image":""},{"number":"15","parValue":"3","yards":"206","body":"The last par 3 is set in a large stand of eucalyptus trees.

The down slope on the left side of the fairway will aid a good tee shot.
