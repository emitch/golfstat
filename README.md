A statistical analysis of how golf is played by the best players in the world.

This project will feed the statistics available on pgatour.com into various machine-learning models in order to:
- Determine what parts of golf are most indicative of (and crucial to) success
- Determine what areas of the game can be improved to create the greatest improvement in performance
- Predict which courses best suit a particular player
- Optimize a player's schedule given their past stats and the potential events for a particular year

Not all of these goals will be achieved, but we hope to produce some interesting results for the average golfer (and amateur statistician).
